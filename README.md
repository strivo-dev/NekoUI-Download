****
# How To Use

> 2. On Windows: C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods
> 3. On Linux/macOS: ~/.minecraft/mods

# Compatibility
NekoUI focuses heavily on UI customization, including layout and background visuals. As a result, **mods that also modify the Minecraft user interface or background rendering** may conflict with NekoUI.

Common sources of incompatibility include:
- Mods that overhaul or replace the main menu or HUD elements.
- Shader-related mods that modify UI layers or apply post-processing to 2D elements.
- Mods that change how background images or textures are loaded and rendered.

If you are experiencing issues such as overlapping elements, broken backgrounds, or UI not appearing as expected, please review your mod list for potential conflicts with UI-altering mods.
****
# Recommendations
To enhance your UI experience while using NekoUI, it is highly recommended to install **font customization mods** that replace the default Minecraft font.

Suggested mods:
- [BetterFonts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterfonts)
- [Smooth Font](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/smooth-font)
- [Caxton](https://modrinth.com/mod/caxton)
- Or any mod that allows replacing Minecraft's default font with clean, modern fonts like **Poppins**, **Inter**, or **Segoe UI**.

Using a modern font will significantly improve readability and the overall visual consistency of the interface customized by NekoUI.
